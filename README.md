A (micro)blogging server that you can self-host.

## Features

- üöÄ Low costs due to small footprint (only a few MB of memory are required).
- üìù Write posts in Markdown.
- üì± Publish and edit from mobile device.
- üìÅ Upload files and images to embed them in posts.
- üîí Automatically backup to plain text files, see [Backup](#backup).

## Background

What made sites like Twitter nice was that it was easy to quickly write something down and later be able to find it back.
For example, say you have just read a nice blog post and want to remember it for later, you could just tweet it.
However, X (formerly Twitter) and most other social media platforms have been locking this down.
Most posts can now only be viewed when you are logged in.
Furthermore, the X algorithm also discourages adding [links in posts](https://x.com/TheBubbleBubble/status/1849818873018610090) so as a user you are incentivized to not add links.
I think this is a sad development since links are an essential part of the internet.

## Installation

Via Docker Compose:

```yml
services:
  fx:
    image: 'rikhuijzer/fx:main'
    container_name: 'fx'
    environment:
      FX_USERNAME: 'john'
      FX_DOMAIN: 'example.com'
    env_file:
      # Contains `FX_PASSWORD="<PASSWORD>"`.
      - 'FX_PASSWORD.env'
    ports:
      - '3000:3000'
    volumes:
      # Stores the SQLite database.
      - './data:/data:rw'
    restart: 'unless-stopped'
```

## API

### Backup

You can backup your site to plain text files with the following shell script:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euxo pipefail

ARCHIVE_PATH="all.tar.xz"

curl \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $FX_PASSWORD" \
  https://$DOMAIN/api/download/all.tar.xz > "$ARCHIVE_PATH"

tar --verbose -xf "$ARCHIVE_PATH"
rm "$ARCHIVE_PATH"
```

where `$FX_PASSWORD` is the admin password (as set via the `FX_PASSWORD` environment variable) and `$DOMAIN` is the domain of your site (for example, `example.com`).

Assuming this file is named `backup.sh` and executable (`chmod +x backup.sh`), you can run a backup in a GitHub Actions workflow with the following YAML:

```yml
name: ci
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '24 0,6,12,18 * * *'
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
  workflow_dispatch:
jobs:
  backup:
    permissions:
      contents: write
    runs-on: ubuntu-24.04
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: ./backup.sh
        env:
          FX_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.FX_PASSWORD }}
      - if: github.event_name != 'pull_request'
        run: |
          if [ -n "$(git status --porcelain)" ]; then
            git config --global user.email "$GITHUB_ACTOR@users.noreply.github.com"
            git config --global user.name "$GITHUB_ACTOR"

            git add .
            git commit -m '[bot] backup'
            git push
          fi

```

This will backup your site every 6 hours.
An example backup repository is [here](https://github.com/rikhuijzer/fx-backup).

To trigger a backup for each change to the website, you can set the following environment variables:

```yml
FX_TRIGGER_TOKEN: 'github_pat_...'
FX_TRIGGER_OWNER_REPO: 'johndoe/fx-backup'
FX_TRIGGER_BRANCH: 'main' # Optional
FX_TRIGGER_WORKFLOW_ID: 'ci.yml' # Optional
```

To obtain the token, you can use the following steps:

1. Go to <https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new>.
1. Set name: `fx-backup-trigger`.
1. Set description: `Used by fx to trigger a backup`.
1. Set repository access: `Only select repositories: <OWNER>/<REPO>`.
1. Set permissions: `Actions` (Read and write).
1. Copy the token.

See the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/actions/workflows?apiVersion=2022-11-28#create-a-workflow-dispatch-event) for more information.

### Update

You can update the `about` text via:

```bash
curl \
  -X PUT \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $FX_PASSWORD" \
  https://$DOMAIN/api/settings/about \
  -d "Some text"
```
